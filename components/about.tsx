        I’m a programmer who moves comfortably across the stack — building clean
        and accessible frontends with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript,
        while also crafting reliable backend systems in PHP. I like tools that
        keep me sharp and efficient, from PortraitNeovim to Node.js with Yarn,
        and I work seamlessly with GitHub and Bitbucket.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed mt-2">
        My focus is turning ideas into working products. I build static sites
        with Gatsby.js and Next.js, push scalable backend features, and keep the
        flow of development smooth with version control and modern workflows. In
        short: I write code that solves problems, and I never stop learning.
